# Health-Dashboard  
This personal project showcases the ability to think and work like a data analyst by building an end-to-end pipeline—from raw data extraction to dashboard visualization—while designing and evaluating meaningful health-related key performance indicators (KPIs).

## 📌 Goal of the Project  

### 1. Think like a professional data analyst: define key performance indicators (KPIs) to answer a business question.  
In this project, I treat my personal health as a "product" I aim to improve. To evaluate the performance of this product, I designed custom KPIs reflecting lifestyle goals.  
- The main KPI is an **Activity Score**: a weighted average of daily steps, active calories, and sleep duration, normalized by personalized targets. A score above 1 indicates goal achievement.  
- Using this score, I summarized average performance and explored trends to better understand my health behaviors.

### 2. Work with real-world data and implement an end-to-end data workflow. 
I worked with real-world, messy data from Apple Health and built a fully automated pipeline:
- 🗂 **Data Extraction**: Exported raw `.XML` files from Apple Health.  
- 🐍 **Data Processing**: Wrote Python scripts to parse and clean the data.  
- 🗃 **Data Storage**: Structured and stored the cleaned data in **MySQL**.  
- 📈 **Data Manipulation**: Used **SQL** to merge and prepare data for analysis.  
- 📊 **Data Visualization**: Connected Tableau to MySQL and built interactive dashboards for data exploration and storytelling.
